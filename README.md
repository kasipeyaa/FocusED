## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture & Core Technologies

The application is built on a modern, local-first AI stack:

* **Frontend:** **Streamlit** is used to create the entire interactive user interface with pure Python.
* **Orchestration:** **LangChain** connects all the different components, from document loading to the final answer generation.
* **LLM:** **Hugging Face `transformers`** runs the `google/flan-t5-base` model locally on your machine for all text generation tasks.
* **Text Extraction:** **PyMuPDF (`fitz`)** efficiently extracts all text content from uploaded PDF files.
* **Vector Store:** **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) creates a high-speed, in-memory vector database for efficient information retrieval.
* **Embeddings:** **SentenceTransformers** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) converts text chunks into numerical vectors that capture their semantic meaning.
